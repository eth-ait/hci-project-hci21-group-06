20:
Analytics hardest
Historic data at sand watch would be useful
Click on sandwich eg to show wow i used a lot less energy last month
Ranking dropdown easy, but arrows even easier
Only looked for item in shop, very easy to find, just scrolled
Didnt find bubbles button, then didnt realize you could click on category

21:
Analytics hardest (!)
Bubble chart was not easy to navigate
Dropdown-menu better than “Slide-menu”
Icons help navigating 
Weird colours 
Colorful cards in A ugly

22: 
B is a lot better
Compact challenges, überblick
Progress bar for challenges confusing, thought task wasnt completed
Dropdown better than arrows, low contrast on arrows, dont know what options are there
Good contrast on you
Color theme customization too much, one theme is better, dont let users use bad color themes
Bar diagram a lot better than bubbles, charts fancy
Clicking not intuitive


23:
Cant directly accept challenges in B
Not much difference between dropdowns an arrows
Shop buy button colors are odd
Want to know absolute value of something in diagram, not just look how long bar is
